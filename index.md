# Welcome to WASA 2025

In the modern automotive landscape, the integration of software and electronics has catalyzed innovations that enhance safety, security, driver experience, and vehicular automation. As the horizon of innovation expands, encompassing developments like self-adaptive algorithms and sophisticated driving automation, the quest for fully autonomous vehicles intensifies. This surge in software dependency has precipitated a paradigmatic shift, necessitating automotive companies to harness architectural and model-based development techniques.
While model-based tools and methodologies are gaining traction as standard languages and tools for crafting automotive control software, broader system and software architecture methodologies remain less universally embraced. A notable exception is the AUTOSAR standard, which delineates the lexicon for designing and configuring automotive software architectures and demarcates principal architectural constituents of automotive systems.

This workshop is dedicated to confronting challenges associated with refining and standardizing automotive system/software architecture and engineering techniques for broader industry acceptance. In alliance with the [International Conference on Software Architecture (ICSA)](https://conf.researchr.org/home/icsa-2025) - a vanguard in the software architecture realm – the Workshop on Automotive System/Software Architecture (WASA) seeks to amalgamate insights from both researchers and practitioners. We aspire that this confluence will not only spotlight novel research trajectories, challenges, and roadmaps but also foster enduring partnerships bridging academia and industry well beyond the workshop's conclusion.

## Call for Papers
The program committee of the 10th WASA edition seeks submissions of original and unpublished high-quality papers describing fundamental and applied research, new methods, approaches, and processes, novel applications, approaches for education and training in automotive system/software architecture, and experience reports on all topics related to software architecture including, but not limited to:
